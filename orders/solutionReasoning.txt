If < 10 units
	and press submit, it does not automatically push to database
	it shows up on the "current orders table"
	then user must press "yes i'm sure"
	**if submit multiple orders to the current orders card, then it duplicates the most recent order in the database**
	//can solve this problem by hiding the submit button or form entirely when the user-
		//submits the order, thereby preventing the user from submitting multiple orders
If > 10 units
	and press submit, it will push the orders to the current orders card
	if user presses "yes i'm sure" then it will push to the database
	**have not yet built functionality to add multiple orders to the current orders card
	**but if user currently presses order history, they can accidentally add multiple orders to the current orders page**
	//can solve this problem by hiding the form entirely when the user hits the order history
		//may need to make a create order button so the user can navigate back to submitting an order

Also may want to consider linking more of the buttons to pages served by the html routes
